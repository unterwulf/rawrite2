RAWRITE2 is a floppy image file writer/creator. It is written in pascal and
compiles with Turbo Pascal 6 or later.

This program was born to help installation of "one floppy" linux systems,
like muLinux (http://sunsite.auc.dk/mulinux), tomsrtbt (http://www.toms.net),
etc.

It is intended to allow the user to create raw images from a floppy or dump
such images to floppy, supporting not only standard formats (360KB, 720KB or
1.44 MB) but a lot more: all fdformat and 2m formats, and any other giving
number of tracks and sectors.
It runs actually under DOS 3.2 or later, Win9x and WinNT (since WinNT only
supports standard formats you only will be able to use such formats under
this inoperating system).
To use 2m formats you will need to install the 2m tsr before using
rawrite2, but DOS 6.2 and later directly supports all fdformat formats.

Since it writes raw images, you always have to supply the floppy format on
a command line option. If the floppy is DOS (FAT) formatted, the program
can be instructed to read the floppy size from the boot sector. If no size
option is given, then a standard 1.44 MB floppy will be supposed.
Run rawrite2 with no parameters to get a help screen.
